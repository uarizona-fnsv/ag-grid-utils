# ag-Gridisms

### It's kinda weird sometimes

ag-Grid can be a little peculiar and opaque in the way it does things and expects to be interacted with.

## Registering Components

Components can be provided to the grid for use as UI:

1. They must be registered as `FrameworkComponents` in the grid options. They can be aliased but it's best to not so that things are obvious.

2. Framework components must also be imported and registered within the component containing `<AgGridVue>`.

<Source
  dark={true}
  language="javascript"
  code={dedent`
  import AgGridVue from "ag-grid-vue"
  import { SearchPanel } from "@uarizona-fnsv/ag-grid-utils"
  export default {
    components: { AgGridVue, SearchPanel },
    data() {
      return {
        gridOptions: {
          frameworkComponents: { SearchPanel: "SearchPanel" }
        }
      }
    }
  }
`}
/>

## Component Params

ad-Grid parameterizes your Vue components by shoemhorning a `params` object onto the Vue instance of your component.

1. It can be a great alternative to syncing grid state to Vuex.
2. It is not a prop or computed property.
3. It is not reactive, so you cannot treat it like a prop or computed property.

   - For instance, it can be dangerous to reference `params` in a computed property; because changes aren't tracked the property's cache will never invalidate.

4. It can be used to pass configuration to your components.

   - For example, parameters can be passed to a filter component instance via `colDef.filterParams` in gridOptions. They can then be accessed as `this.params.colDef.filterParams` in the filter component.

## Metadata

You can put arbitrary data on grid objects like colDefs by putting it under the `__metadata__` property! Adding it to other places will cause ag-Grid to throw error unless you set `gridOptions.suppressPropertyNamesCheck`... which is a horrible solution.

## Grid Options

gridOptions objects are mutated by the grid. As the grid mounts, it will add `gridApi` and `columnApi` objects to the provided gridOptions object. Mutations to the object after mount can also be reflected in the grid.

This means: _do not share gridOptions objects between grid instances._
