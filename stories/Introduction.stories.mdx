# ag-Grid Utils

### _Almost as good as Excel_ â„¢

These components and classes are designed to make it easir to integrate ag-Grid with [Django REST Framework](https://github.com/encode/django-rest-framework), [Django Filter](https://github.com/carltongibson/django-filter), and [Django REST Framework Filters](https://github.com/philipn/django-rest-framework-filters)
via the [server-side row model](https://www.ag-grid.com/archive/21.2.0/javascript-grid-server-side-model/).

Each component story contains a full grid setup with the component, column defs, and a datasource. Use these stories as living usage examples!

## The Rundown

0. Make your data available via a Django Rest Framework, ex:

```python
from rest_framework.viewsets import ModelViewSet, ReadOnlyModelViewSet
from rest_framework.pagination import LimitOffsetPagination
from rest_framework import filters
from rest_framework_filters import backends

class MyViewSet(ReadOnlyModelViewSet):
    pagination_class = LimitOffsetPagination
    filter_backends = [
        filters.SearchFilter,
        filters.OrderingFilter
        backends.RestFrameworkFilterBackend,
    ]
    filterset_class = MyFilter
    ordering_fields = "__all_related__"
    # ...
```

1. Use the included [Datasource class](/?path=/story/javascript-datasource--page) to fetch data from the API.

2. Create column definitions for your data. [Register](/?path=/story/docs-ag-gridisms--page#registering-components) and use the components for use as panels and filters. The component stories contain complete grid configurations as examples. Use the [`__metadata__.type` property](/?path=/story/docs-ag-gridisms--page#metadata) to give the filter components more information about your fields.
